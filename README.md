Exercise 2 on the Udemy "Hey Frank" exercise involves writing a simple C++ program that outputs the message "Hi Frank" to the console. The code is provided and includes the standard main() function, which is the entry point for C++ programs.

The program uses the using directive to bring the std namespace into scope, allowing it to use the std::cout object to output text to the console. The main code for the exercise involves writing the command to output the message "Hi Frank" to the console, which is achieved by calling the std::cout object and passing the message as an argument using the insertion operator "<<".

Overall, this exercise provides a basic introduction to C++ programming syntax, including the use of namespaces and outputting text to the console.
